    Introduction to SASS and SCSS 
    --------------------------
    > SASS : Semantically Awesome Style Sheets (is old and cumbersome to write as it was
                made on CSS v1)
    > SCSS : Sassy Cascading Style Sheets (is the new form and better than SASS as it was build on CSS v3 which is the 
                current version)

    > Make a seperated folder for all the scss files 
        - scss
                - style.scss

    > SCSS is ultimately converted into CSS in the end so it better to make a seperated 
        folder for it , as all the coverted css files will be in that folder only 
    > This folder is configured to be made in the root directory (We put it in the setting json file for scss)
    > so when ever the scss file is changed, the css files will be generated in a folder called
        css

    1. Variables in SCSS : 
        $color-tomato:tomato;

    2. Nesting in SCSS : (note the .elements are inheriting the properties of navbar (parent))
        .navbar {
            width: 100%;
            height: 60px;
            max-width: 1200px;
            margin: 0 auto;
            display: flex;
            align-items: center;
            justify-content: space-between;

            .links {
                display: flex;
                gap: 2rem;
            }

            .toggle_btn {
                color: white;
                font-size: 1.5rem;
                cursor: pointer;
                display: none;
            }

           .logo a{
            font-size: 1.5rem;
            }
        }

    
    3. Nesting effects like Hover and action : 
        .action_btn{
            background-color: $color-tomato;
            color: white;
            padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
            border: none;
            outline: none;
            border-radius: 20px;
            font-size: 0.8rem;
            font-weight: bold;
            cursor: pointer;
            transition: scale 0.2 ease;

            // SCSS approach : 
            &:hover{
                scale: 1.05;
                color: white;
            }

            &:active{
                scale: 1.95;
            }
        }


    4. Modules 
    ----------
    > the name of a module scss file starts with an underscore (_moduleName.scss)
    > can be used to store some of the common styles which will be needed throughtout
        the website 
    > These will then hae to be imported into the pages's main css file
