/*
*          Agenda : Uncontrolled Components
*   ---------------------------------------
*   1. Getting multiple input data from forms (a controlled component)  
*   2. Getting data from Uncontrolled component
*/

/*
    Controlled Component : which uses useState to update the variables 
    Uncontrolled Component : which doesn't use useStates to update the variable
*/

/*  
    In Controlled1.jsx we can see that it is difficult to handle useStates if 
    there are mutitple form input fields

    In Controlled2.jsx, we use a single useState as an object which will 
    take care of all the changing variables
