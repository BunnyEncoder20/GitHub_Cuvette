    React Routing 
    ------------
    > React doesn't have anything in-built to handle rounting on it's own
    > Rounting is important , as me manytimes need to make multiple pages of the website 
        which is not possible without routing (route = link of the page you currently at)
        https://myDomain/index.html = home page
        https://myDomain/about.html = about page

    > Package widely used : react-router-dom (V6)
    ***NOTE : V5 of react-router-dom is very different from the latest version V6
    > To check the version of current packages installed in the project visit : 
        package.json file 
*/

/*
    Using the Browser Router in React
    ------------------------------
    > Note that the browserRouter should be loaded from the same place where all the 
        other components of the app are being loaded from (else routing may not function as intended)
    > <BrowserRouter> is used for defining that all the components within (Maybe say App.jsx
        are up for routing)
    > Apart from that, when we define other components which will make routing (or page
        change to happen) we need to use the <routes></routes> tags (to define a bunch of routes)
    
    > Though routing may seem very nice , but we should try for internal links installed
    > This helps in eliminating the reloading / loading of new pages and makes the websites
        faster
    > Generally the external routing is handled by the deployment service you use 
    > Hence we just need to focus on the internal routing

/*
    Using Link to in React Rounting 
    ---------------------------
    > <Link to=''> is the tag which is used for internal routing
    > It helps revent unecessary loading / reloading of pages whenever we try to route
        to new page / internal link
    > Eg : 
        import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
        
        <div>I'm a AboutPage</div>
        <Link to="/">Click to go to HomePage</Link>

        <div>I'm a HomePage</div>
        <Link to="/about">Click to go to AboutPage</Link>
