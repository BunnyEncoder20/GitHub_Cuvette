/*
    Folder Structure 
    ---------------
    > node_modules : for all the dependencies 
    > public : contains the files which will be pulling the info from the js,css,jsx files from
        the src folder (we target the root element in the index.html)
    
    Recommended Practices : 
    > Create a separate folder for all components 
        Create Folder for each components (Eg: Header, Footer, Card, etc)
    > prefer using .jsx instead of .js for to make it easier to write jsx
    > When creating multiple Pages, we can create a separate folder called pages / screens / routes
    > A seperate folder for APIs
    > A seperate folder for assets (like images, logos, svgs, etc)
    > A seperate folder for Hooks
    > A seperate folder for utility functions 

*/

/*
    Events in jsx
    -----------
    > They are similar to all the event in js 
    > Eg : onClick(), onChange(), onDoubleClick(), etc
*/

/*
    Controlled vs Uncontrolled components 
    -----------------------------------
    Controlled Conponent : when we are able to directly read the inputs put in a form 
        using React, then it is called Controlled COmponent 
    
    Uncontrolled Component :  when we need to make the use of some DOM functionalities 
        to read the form data cause we are unable to handle them using React itself, They
        are called Uncontrolled components  
*/

/*
    Forms in React 
    -------------
    > Forms can be made in the App.jsx using basic jsx. The challenge is to access the data 
        entered in the inputs 
    > For that we'll use states.
    > First simple approach is to make separate states for each 
    Eg: 
        function App() {

            const [name, setName] = useState('');
            const [age, setAge] = useState(18);
            const [email, setEmail] = useState('');

            return (
                <>  
                    <form>
                        Name: <input type="text"name='name'/> <br />
                        Age : <input type="text" name='age'/> <br />
                        email : <input type="text" name='email'/> <br />
                    </form>
                </>
            );
        } 
    
    > To access the changes made to the input, we can use the onChange event : 
    Eg : 
        <form>
            Name: <input type="text"name='name' onChange={(event)=>{console.log(event.target.value)}}/> <br />
        </form>
    > Note how we are accessing only the data of the event object by using e.target.value
    > In the same way we can assign these values to the State variabels : 
    Eg : 
        <form>
            Name: <input type="text"name='name' onChange={(e)=>{setName(e.target.value)}}/> <br />
        </form>

    > But this is not a efficient way to use states and forms as in there can be many 
        more inputs in the form. 
    > Better way would be to get create one single state variable which will handle all
        the state changes 
*/

/*
    Form Validations
    ---------------
    > When submitting a form there are usually validation which need to be done
    > We can define a function for that 
    > By default html has the functioning of reloading the page when a form is submitted 
    > To diable this feature in React, we can do : 
    Eg : 
        let validation = (e)=>{
          e.preventDefault();   // This line revents the page from reloading and we are able to see the output on the console
          console.log('Validating the Form...');
        } 
    
    > Simple form validation can be done like : 
    Eg : 
        if(name.length<3 || name.length>15)
            alert("Name should be between 3-15 characters")
    
    > For more complex and extensive validation we can use packages like 'yup'
    Link : https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup
    command to install : npm i yup

    > Can also use regex and tenary operator to valid the inputs like eamils 
*/

/*
    Use one State for all the form inputs 
    --------------------------------
    > Me make a single state variable which will be a object with all the variables
    Eg : 
        let [ formData, setFormData] = useState({
            name:"",
            age:0,
            email:""
        }) ;
    
    > Then we are going to make a common fucntion to handle the changes :
