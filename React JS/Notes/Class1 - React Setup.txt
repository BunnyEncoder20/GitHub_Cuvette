/*
    Why React ? 
    -----------
    > Using Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS we have no premade frameworks, libraries 
    > There is a lot of manual work 
    > There is not efficency (when we click on anything everthing on the page is reloaded) 
    > lot of re-work  

    > Module < Library < framework

    > Module : is a folder which provides some fucntionality 
    > Library : is a collection of modules. Which provides some pre-defined (eg: React)
    > Framework : is a colection of many pre-defined Libraries and fucntions (eg : Angular)


    Pre-requesites for React 
    ----------------------
    1. node.js
    2. npm


    How to install packages using npm Syntax:
    npm install creat-react-app
    
    > Note this will install the necessary files onto your system. If you want to just 
        execute the package without installing it on your system, then use npx (node package executable)
    
    Syntax : npx creat-react-app "appName"
    > Note that we do not write the install here  
    > This is not recommended all the time 
    > We can use it with the creat-react-app as we just need it's boilerplate template

    Alternative Syntax (Cleaner and lighter)
    > npm create vite@latest app-Name -- -- template react
    // cd to project directory 
    > npm install 
    //start the dev server 
    > npm run dev

*/


/*
    > Once the packages are installed you'll get the proper folder structure and files 
        required for a react project.


    > Common Commands which are used in the React Project folder 
        1. npm start : starts the development server 
        2. npm run build :  bundles the app into static files for production 
        3. starts the test runner
