DOM : Document Oject Model 
-------------------------
-> Not a part of / concept of core JS. It is something that is created by the browser. 
-> DOM is like a interface between the HTML / CSS elements and the JS

-> window : (type and enter in console of browser) is like a universal (more like a 
    galaxy) parent object of everyhting we see on the browser window
-> One of it's properties is the document (kinda like a solar system)
-> Document will contain all the things required to manipulate our entire html 
    document.

-> HTML (the tag) has also become an object now


#1) Accessing your DOM elements 
-----------------------------
Using methods : 
document.getElementByID('ID') ;
document.getElementsByClassName('Class_Name') ;
document.getElementsByTagName('HTML_Tag') ;

***Remember that : 
    -> document.getElementByID() returns one unique html element
    -> document.getElementsByClassName() returns an htmlCollection
        (an array of elements), in which  the actual html elements are 
        accessible using index
    -> document.getElementByTagName() also behaves same as ClassName()
