# How to LeetCode 
## 1. MUST know DSA üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- it is very important to know DSA as these are the right tools to do the programming questions 
- you might come up with the solution but they are might no be the most correct or optimized 
- DSA is important for understanding the solutions of these questions also
---
## 2. How to solve a LeetCode problem üíª
1. Read the problem (description) thoroughly. Then read it again. Don't touch keyboard until you understand everything about the problem statement.
2. Think of possible solutions on Paper (also think about edge cases - null or zero or very large inputs, etc)
3. Implement the solution (be very familiar with your coding language)
4. Know your space and time complexity (write it in comments after a function or loop)
5. Rinse and repeat. Stay consistent. 
    - **you'll improve more if you understand what you are actually doing , rather than just copy pasting the solution and hitting submit**
6. The whole Leetcoding is to level up your understanding of DSA and your problem solving skills
    - your solution to the problems will be different so always come up with a soltuion before going to the discussion page
