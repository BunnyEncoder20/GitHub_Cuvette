    Flex Boxes 
    ---------
    Container - The main parent element within which all the Flex boxes will be contained
    Items - The flex boxes 
    Flow - (row-wise or column-wise) is the direction in which the flex boxes are arranged 
    Main axis - when the items(flex boxes) are being arranged in this axis 
    Cross axis - the other axis which is not the main axis 
*/

#container{
    height: 100vh;  /*vh : take it as % of visible height */
    width: 100vw;  /*vw : viewport width same as above*/
    background-color: black;

    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row; /*By default it is row*/

    /* 
        justify Conetent : is always reletive to the main axis only 
        aligns the items across the main axis current row or col
    */
    /* justify-content: flex-start;  */
    /* justify-content: flex-end; */
    /* justify-content: center; */

    /*justify-content: space-between; /* no space at start or end of flex but equal space in between*/
    justify-content: space-around; /* there will be some gap at the start and end of the flex*/
    /*justify-content: space-evenly; /* there will be equal distance between the start end and the space in between*/

    /* Align Items : will always arrange the items along the cross axis  */

        1. Flex-grow
        -----------
        Flex grow makes the Flex boxes grow when there is space available 
        flex-grow : 1 (if written in all the boxes then all will get the same space 
        flex-grow : 2 (this box will grow with twice the rate as compared to the boxes with flex-grow:1

        2. flex-shrink
        ------------
        Flex-shrink makes the flex boxes shrink at desired rate
        flex-shrink : 1 (if all have this then they are shrink at the same rate 
        flex-shrink : 2 (the box with this will shrink at twice the rate of boxes with flex-shrink:1)
