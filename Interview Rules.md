# Technical Placement Mistakes to Avoid 
----
## 1. Improver Resume ‚ùå
- make resume of **pure tech** experiences only üë®‚Äçüíª
- don't add time pass projects and hobbies
- Eg : Tech Skills, Tech Internships, Tech Projects
- make resume ATS (Application Tracking System) friendly (specially for Big tech companies)
    - use as much technically words as possible 
    - also in Project Section , mention the technologies used in that project

## 2. No backlogs ‚ùå
- shouldn't be a problem 

## 3. Casual Attitude :x:
- This takes many forms : 
    1. Formal DressCode : always dress up in good, clean and Formals
    2. don't be late to Interview : 
        -  1-15 mins early for online interview 
        - 45 mins early to offline interview location
    3. Don't show attitude / egoistic side 
        - always be polite to interviewer (even if he is being wrong/idiot)
        - never let your ego show
    
## 4. Low GPA üìâ
- no need to worry 

## 5. Not applying in Bulk
- we have to apply to **ATLEAST 50-100** companies
- give interviews of **30-40** companies 
- then **maybe** get selected in **5-8** companies  
- Even if you get till interview rounds of a company, don't stop applying for new companies 
- hence keep applying for companies until you get offer letter in hand 
- Build a Good Network for referrals (LinkedIn)
    - This improves the chances in shortlisting and interview
