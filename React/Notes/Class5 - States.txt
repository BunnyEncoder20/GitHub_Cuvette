/*
    States 
    --------
    > are special variables which are auto re-rendered everytime when their values are 
        updated , across all the instances / components 
    > But we cannot use them directly , we need to know about hooks

    > Hooks can be thought of as special Functionality givers which allow React Functional
        components to have access to functions which where before exclusive to React 
        Class based components 
    
    > Syntax for using States : 
        import {useState} from 'react 
        // can combine this in the import React from 'react' line like : 
        import React,{useState} from 'react'

    > to write syntax for useState use shortcut : ' useState '
    > useState() return 2 things : 
        1. variable
        2. a function (a set fucntion, convectionally : setFuncName)
    Eg : 
        const [state, setstate] = useState(initialState);

    > To update a state variable : 
        setstate(updatedValue++) ;


    > Resetting a state variable : we make a fucntion which will reset the state to its 
        previous / original value
