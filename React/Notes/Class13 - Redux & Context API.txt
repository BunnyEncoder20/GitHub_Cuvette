/*
    Prop Drilling 
    ------------
    > In situation where we want to pass a prop from C1 to C4 (C2 child of c1, c3 cild of c2 and so on)
        C1->C2->C3->C4 , then we pass them from C2 and C3 even though they do not require 
        it.
    > This situation is called Prop Drilling 

    > A fix is to store the necessary data in some place where any of the components of
        our app can access it, like a common data store. 
        AKA Context API
    > This will work for small scale projects 

    > For Large scale projects where there is a lot of conplexity with storing the data,
    we use Redux toolkit
*/

/*
    Context API 
    -----------
    1. Create a new file for the context 
        myContext.jsx
    
    2. Import createContext from react and make a context with default values
        import { createContext } from "react";
        const myContext = createContext("");
        export default myContext

    3. Create Component which would need to store some data in the context 

    4. Create state variables in the Parent component (App.jsx)
        let [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

    5. Wrap the components which need the access to teh context with the <myContext></myContext>
        <myContext.Provider>
          <Counter/>
        </myContext.Provider>
    myContext.Provider as this is where the context wil be provided 

    6. Pass the values which we need to store also from here 
        <myContext.Provider value={{counter, setCounter}}> // passing an object here
          <Counter/>
        </myContext.Provider>

        // NOTE that the myContext.Provider attribute is 'value' and not 'values'

    7. Now we can directly access those data from the Context store now using 
        useContext. Also will have to import he context we created 
        import React,{useContext} from 'react'
        import myContext from './myContext'

    8. Accessing the data using context 
        let dataFromContext = useContext(myContext) ;

    9. Using the data in the component as need : 
        function Counter() {
            let dataFromContext = useContext(myContext) ;
          return (
            <div>
                <h1>{dataFromContext.counter}</h1>
                <button onClick={()=>{dataFromContext.setCounter(dataFromContext.counter++)}}>Count +1</button>
            </div>
          )
        }
         
    10. Thought this solves the problem we were having but as me have to juggle the 
        context between 3 or more files and we have to properly wrap the <myContext> 
        tag around the compoenents, it is a hetic process when we are working with 
        large scale production aapplications

    11. Hence we can use 3rd party tools like Redux-toolkit 
*/

/*
    Redux
    ------
    > It is a predictable state container for JS apps 
    > It works kinda like a container which will hold all the states, so any component 
        needing that data can access it 
    > It is centralized debuggable (can track which line state data went where and when) 
        and flexiable (runs on any UI layer and large ecosystem of addons)

    > It is not specific to React , we can use it with multiple tech (Like angularJS)

    > Redux, by default is very tidious to configure and set , so we use Redux ToolKit to
        as it is a standarized approach for writing Redux logic 

    > Redux has the following components : 
    1. view : any component which is displayed on the site 
    2. action  : any action which is performed on the component (eg: clicking on button)
    3. reducer : is a special kinda function which has direct access to the store which 
        listens to the action and does something based on that. Note that there will be only 
        one of these fucntions in your app
    4. store : only the reducer can change the data in the store. Components (view) can 
        fetch data from these stores and display them in the view part 

    Hence resulting in the following unidirectional flow : 
    view -> action -> reducer -> store -> view (the cycle is closed loop back to start)  

    5. slice : there are a lot of category of data which can be stored in the store so to 
        organise them into different files , we call these slices

/*
    Implementing Redux in a simple Counter App
    --------------------------------------
    1. Create a new folder for all the redux files 
        > Redux
    
    2. Create a file called store.js 
        store.js
    
    3. Write the necesary code for making a redux store : (avaliable in quickstart guide on their website)
        import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
        export const store = configureStore({
          reducer: {},
        })

    4. Wrapping the App component with the <Provider> tag so that all the components 
        in app have access to the store (either in index.js or main.jsx) : 
        import { store } from './Redux/store'
        import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

        ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
            <Provider store={store}>
            <App />
            </Provider>
        )

    5. Creating a Slice (combination of inital states reducer and actions)
        > Create a new file in the Redux folder : 
            nameSlice.js 
        > Put in the general code of a slice there , export the actions and the redcucer itself also 
        > Eg : simple counterSlice.js
        import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

        const initialState = {
          value: 0,
        }

        export const counterSlice = createSlice({
          name: 'counter',

          initialState,

          reducers: {
            increment: (state) => {
              state.value += 1
            },
            decrement: (state) => {
              state.value -= 1
            },
            incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
              state.value += action.payload     
            },
          },
        })

        // Action creators are generated for each case reducer function
        export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions

        export default counterSlice.reducer

        6. Gathering all the reducers of various slices and importing them into the store.js 
            (as mentioned earlier we can only have one reducer function)
            import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
            import counterSlice from './counterSlice'

            export const store = configureStore({
              reducer: {
                    counter : counterSlice
              },
            })

        7. Making the component to do acition and display the data from the store  :
            a. new file : componentName.jsx

            b. imports : 
                import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
                import { decrement, increment } from './Redux/counterSlice'
                NOTE : 
                    * useDispatch is used to call reducer whenever some action is done 
                    * useSelector is used to select the data from the store and display it in the view 
                    * increment and decrement are the destructured functions which we export in slice file 
                    Eg :
                        < button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())} > Increment </button>
                        < button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())} > Decrement </button>
            
            c.
